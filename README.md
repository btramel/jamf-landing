# Jamf Homepage

**Features**: sleek animated hamburger menu on mobile, TailwindCSS custom color variables, mobile-first responsive design including four screen-size breakpoints

I hadn't used the Tailwind CSS framework before but _had_ heard plenty about it, so when I wanted some more practice with mobile-first design after my latest React project, I had to try it out. So I made a responsive, mobile-first mock landing page for a local tech business called Jamf using Tailwind and some media I pulled from their website.

Tailwind's <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation">documentation</a> is some of the best and most comprehensive I've used, which made it a joy to learn. The benefits of Tailwind seem to be easy custom color variables, simple media query setup, and responsive _everything_. If you can stomach the class-based workflow inside of HTML, it seems quite efficient.

Below you can see how Tailwind let me set up custom variables and breakpoints in one place:

The project is hosted on Github Pages. <a href="https://btramel.github.io/jamf-landing/">Go feel the responsiveness for yourself.</a> Don't forget to hit that hamburger menu on mobile!
